Delta Testing

for T = 300 & 500
Dual Bargraph SADF vs Delta (N = 2,5)


Main Sim


ONE BIG GRAPH:
for each num series
for each num_rw
triple bar graph (coint_fact = 0.4,0.6,0.8) for each T
Y = SADF (3 values for each T)
X = T

Possible then 3D chart for the above


Plot:
- Smaller sample --> coint_frac matters, Larger sample --> coint_frac doesn't matter

- Does 40 or 60 % really matter ?



Questions:
- Does 40/60% really matter ?
- Does coint_fract really matter? for each length
