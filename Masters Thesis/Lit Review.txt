One of the influential works done in bubble detection was from \cite{Diba1988}. They argued that rationally the asset prices should reflect the present value of expected future dividends. The stationarity of both dividends and the assets prices should be the same and also their linear combination should be stationary. The presence of a rational bubble—an explosive, non-mean-reverting component—would break this long-run relationship, resulting in a loss of cointegration. To test this, \cite{Diba1988} estimate a cointegrating regression of stock prices on dividends and then applied stationarity tests to the residuals of the regression following \cite{EngleGranger1987}. They compliment this with autocorrelation analysis, Bhargava tests (\cite{Bhargava1986}), and simulations of artificial bubble series to confirm that their approach can detect explosiveness when present. This residual-based cointegration approach became a foundational methodology in the early literature on bubble detection. Later studies extend this framework to other markets such as \cite{Gallin2005} applies a similar cointegration approach to the U.S. housing market to test whether house prices and rents are cointegrated which is apparent as rents represent the fundamental value of housing. Gallin uses Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests and a long-horizon regression framework, inspired by \cite{campbell2001valuation} and \cite{Mark1995}, combined with bootstrap techniques to handle possible biases in error correction. His results suggest that sustained cointegration between house prices and rents indicates the absence of bubbles. Likewise, Chan and Woo (2006) also apply cointegration-based tests to hyperinflation episodes in Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Russia. Using the money demand model from \cite{Cagan1956}, they employ Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) unit root test approch by \cite{Caner&Hansen2001} on the residuals of cointegrating regressions to capture nonlinear and regime-switching dynamics characteristic of collapsing and re-inflating bubbles. These early works demonstrate that testing the stationarity of residuals from cointegrating relationships is a direct and practical method for assessing whether a time series exhibits explosive behavior or remains tied to fundamentals.

However, a key limitation of static cointegration tests is their inability to detect temporally localized bubbles—that is, bubbles that form, collapse, and possibly re-emerge—as first highlighted by \cite{Evans1991}. To address this,\cite{Phillips2011} introduced the Sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF) test, a recursive right-tailed unit root test based on forward-expanding ADF regressions. The SADF test detects periods when the autoregressive root exceeds one ($\delta > 1$) allowing for real-time identification and date-stamping of bubble phases. Recognizing that SADF may still struggle to detect multiple bubbles or complex dynamics, \cite{Phillips2015} further developed the Generalized sup ADF (GSADF) test which employs double-recursive windowing where both the start and end points of the regression windows vary. This enhanced the test’s ability to capture multiple and distinct explosive episodes. These innovations represent a major methodological advance in the literature on bubble detection.

In recent years, researchers have widely adopted SADF and GSADF tests in both individual series and panel settings, but typically these tests are applied directly to raw price series not to cointegration residuals. \cite{Podhorsky2024} is a notable exception combining Engle-Granger cointegration with SADF testing in the context of Bitcoin. Podhorsky first establishes cointegration between Bitcoin prices and marginal mining costs and then applies SADF tests both to the raw price series and to the residuals of the cointegration regression between costs and the prices. This approach enables a distinction between fundamentally-driven volatility and true speculative bubbles.

In the panel data literature, the dominant trend has been to apply SADF/GSADF either to individual series within the panel or to a set of panel. \cite{Horie2016} for instance propose a factor-augmented framework for large panel datasets. They decompose each series into common factors and idiosyncratic components and then apply SADF/BSADF tests to these components individually. Importantly, they do not apply a panel GSADF test or test residuals from cointegration models. Similarly, \cite{Potrykus2023} employs GSADF and panel GSADF tests on commodity panels using sieve bootstrap to address cross-sectional dependence. The tests are applied directly to the price series of individual commodities and to the set of panels but not to residuals from cointegration relationships. Likewise, \cite{Cunado2005} conduct GSADF/BSADF testing at the level of individual country house price series and then use a panel of bubble indicators in subsequent modelling. Again, they do not test residuals from cointegration models.

In sum the literature has clearly evolved from static residual-based cointegration tests to recursive ADF-based testing. However, despite the increasing sophistication of these methods the application of these tests to the residuals of cointegrating relationships of systems of time series remains rare. Aside from \cite{Podhorsky2024}, most recent studies apply these tests directly to raw prices. This reveals that applying unit root tests to cointegration residuals remains a largely underutilized method, particularly for detecting system-wide bubbles. Addressing this gap could yield important insights for markets where fundamental relationships are expected to hold but may temporarily break down under speculative pressures.
